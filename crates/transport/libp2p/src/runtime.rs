//! Swarm ownership, bounded channels, and deterministic shutdown.
//!
//! # One task owns the Swarm
//!
//! A `Swarm` is not `Sync` and must be polled from one place. It is
//! therefore moved into a dedicated task, and everything else talks to
//! it through channels. That is not merely an implementation detail: it
//! is what makes "the policy snapshot is read without blocking the
//! Swarm poll" (ADR-0011) achievable later, because nothing outside the
//! task can hold the Swarm at all.
//!
//! # Both channels are BOUNDED
//!
//! CLAUDE.md §6 requires it, and the reason is visible here. An
//! unbounded event channel would let a slow consumer turn a burst of
//! remote activity into unbounded local memory — a remote peer choosing
//! how much memory this process uses. Bounded means the Swarm task
//! applies backpressure to itself instead, which is the correct place
//! for the cost to land.
//!
//! # Shutdown is deterministic, and proved so
//!
//! [`SwarmRuntime::shutdown`] sends a command, then **awaits the task's
//! join handle**. It does not drop a handle and hope. The exit gate says
//! "shut down without leaked tasks", and the only way to know a task
//! ended is to have waited for it.
