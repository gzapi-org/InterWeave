# Self-test for check_vendored_advisories.sh.
#
# The case that matters is the POSITIVE one: a vendored crate carrying a
# RustSec advisory must fail. `atty 0.2.14` is the fixture, because it is
# the crate the guard's own help cites as the measurement — it carries
# RUSTSEC-2021-0145 and RUSTSEC-2024-0375, and path-patching it is what
# made `cargo deny check advisories` fall silent.
#
# The sandbox's vendored directory is a manifest and nothing else: the
# guard reads only a name and a version from it and then asks the
# registry about that version, so no source is needed to exercise it.
#
# The guard checks for `cargo-deny` before it does anything else and
# exits 2 without it, so EVERY case here needs it -- this self-test
# skips whole rather than degrading to a subset, which an earlier
# revision of this comment got wrong.
