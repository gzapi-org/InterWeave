# CLAUDE.md — InterWeave repository operating contract

This file is the working contract for Claude Code and other coding agents operating in the InterWeave repository. Read it before making changes.

## 1. Repository state

InterWeave is currently an **accepted architecture plus implementation/test skeleton**.

- `architecture/` is the normative design source.
- `apps/`, `crates/`, `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `test-data/`, `spikes/`, `packaging/`, and `xtask/` are tracked landing zones created by ADR-0045.
- The root Cargo workspace intentionally has zero members until implementation begins.
- There is no production Rust implementation yet.
- Display name is **InterWeave**. Machine/wire namespace is lowercase `interweave` per ADR-0047.
- Do not reintroduce the former pre-InterWeave namespace into current production constants, fixtures, paths, package names, or documentation except when discussing history explicitly.

The canonical construction order is:

- `architecture/roadmap/BOTTOM-UP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- ADR-0046

Historical numbered phases are scope/release labels; they are not a safe dependency order.

## 2. Source-of-truth hierarchy

Before changing behavior, inspect the relevant material rather than inferring it from filenames or old discussion.

Use this order:

1. accepted ADRs, including explicit supersession/amendment language;
2. normative contracts under `architecture/contracts/` and protocol/backend specifications under `architecture/transport/`, `architecture/discovery/`, and `architecture/clients/`;
3. the canonical bottom-up implementation plan and test gates;
4. architecture explanatory documents/reviews;
5. examples and research notes.

If two accepted documents appear to conflict, **do not silently choose one in code**. Identify the conflict and amend/clarify the architecture first.

When a spike or implementation experiment disproves an accepted assumption, update the relevant ADR/contract in the same change before treating the new behavior as canonical.

## 3. Stage discipline

Do not create production code simply because a landing-zone directory exists.

When a canonical stage is explicitly opened:

1. implement only the package(s) needed by that stage;
2. create their manifests/source at that time;
3. add those exact paths to `[workspace].members` in the same change;
4. add the lowest-layer tests needed to prove the stage exit gate;
5. keep later-stage functionality inert even if a dependency exposes it early.

Hard sequencing rule:

> Root ConnectionManager/DialAdmissionGate, pre-auth resource admission, and address-scoped failure/quarantine behavior must be implemented and green before Kademlia, AutoNAT, Circuit Relay, or DCUtR are activated.

Do not turn on autonomous libp2p behaviour and plan to retrofit admission policy later.

## 4. Placement and dependency rules

### Applications

`apps/*` are thin composition roots. They may wire configuration, logging, runtime construction, platform startup/shutdown, and UI/application adapters. Reusable domain/network logic belongs in `crates/*`.

### Neutral APIs

`crates/api/*` and other explicitly neutral contracts must not depend on:

- libp2p types;
- Slint UI types;
- Android/JVM types;
- SQLite implementation types;
- Claude SDK/MCP implementation types;
- platform-specific socket/process types unless the contract explicitly requires them.

Translate backend/platform concepts at the boundary rather than leaking them upward.

### Tests

Put a test at the **lowest layer that completely proves the behavior**:

- pure/local logic -> unit test beside source;
- public crate surface -> `<crate>/tests/`;
- cross-crate/network/conformance -> root `tests/<suite>/`;
- desktop process behavior -> `tests/desktop-e2e/`;
- Android OS behavior -> instrumented Android tests and `tests/android-e2e/`.

Do not replace a real-network/process/platform requirement with mocks merely to make a test easier.

`tests/support` is test-only and must never be a production dependency.

### Fixtures vs test data

- `fixtures/` = normative/frozen deterministic vectors. Changes require explicit protocol/spec review.
- `test-data/` = mutable non-normative scenarios/topologies/input sets.
- `spikes/` = empirical evidence only. Spike code never becomes a production dependency by accident.

## 5. Non-negotiable architecture boundaries

### Identity and endpoint routing

- One profile owns one persistent PeerId.
- EndpointIds are configured routing selectors beneath a PeerId, not cryptographic identities, people, roles, or authorization principals.
- Direct-capable local sessions obtain one exclusive configured endpoint lease.
- Source EndpointId is derived from the local lease, never trusted from arbitrary caller input.
- Endpoint-specific policy may narrow profile trust but never widen it.
- A remote source EndpointId is peer-asserted metadata only.

### Directed messaging

- Directed traffic uses `/interweave/direct/2.0.0`.
- Never route directed traffic over GossipSub.
- Direct v2 resolves to exactly one destination endpoint.
- Omitted destination means configured remote default endpoint, never fan-out.
- `AcceptedV2` means bounded remote endpoint queue admission, not application processing or human read.
- Remote endpoint unknown/offline/disabled/policy-denied stays coarse on the wire (`no_route` class) to avoid an authorization oracle.

### Broadcast

- Broadcast uses signed GossipSub.
- Mesh duplicate identity is based on authenticated publisher PeerId + wire sequence number, not application envelope ID.
- GossipSub validation follows ADR-0029: objective invalidity = Reject; valid but locally unauthorized publisher = Ignore; valid and authorized = Accept.
- EndpointId is not authenticated broadcast authorship.

### Discovery and Kademlia

- Discovery is advisory candidate reachability. It does not grant trust, dial directly, route application messages, manage subscriptions, or interpret payloads.
- Kademlia is peer routing only.
- Never put EndpointId, ChannelId, application data, trust records, membership records, or human presence into the DHT.
- Standard-v1 Kademlia is default-enabled when configured, with explicit opt-out, but activation still obeys the canonical implementation stage order.

### Connection and Internet reachability

- All outbound dials, including behaviour-originated dials, pass the root DialAdmissionGate.
- Distinguish address failures from peer failures; a bad/mismatched address must not unnecessarily suppress a known-good route to a trusted PeerId.
- Bound unauthenticated/pre-Noise resource use.
- AutoNAT/Relay infrastructure authorization is separate from application data-plane trust.
- Standard v1 includes AutoNAT v2 client, Circuit Relay v2 client/reservation management, and DCUtR.

### Local client / IPC

- Desktop data and admin authority use separate IPC boundaries.
- A data connection cannot obtain `admin.*` authority by claiming a client kind.
- Admin connections do not obtain application endpoint leases.
- IPC v2 JSON body ceiling remains 128 KiB and must accommodate every legal 48 KiB direct application payload plus envelope/endpoint overhead.
- Android does not fake desktop IPC: it uses the neutral `LocalDataSession` boundary in-process.

### Human client retention

Transport remains realtime/non-durable. The human application may durably retain exactly the states allowed by ADR-0044/`architecture/clients/human/RETENTION.md`:

- pending outbound;
- unread inbound;
- inbound explicitly kept by the receiver after reading.

Once outbound becomes transport-terminal, its durable pending copy is removed. Once inbound becomes read and is not kept, its durable copy is removed. A remote sender cannot request or force receiver persistence.

If the human store cannot durably accept unread content, the human endpoint/local human delivery must degrade rather than silently violate the retention contract.

## 6. Security and secret handling

Never commit or print real:

- transport private keys/seeds;
- recovery mnemonics;
- Android signing/Keystore secrets;
- production credentials/tokens;
- real user profile state;
- private relay/probe infrastructure credentials.

`.gitignore` is defense-in-depth, not permission to place secrets inside the repository tree.

Use synthetic deterministic fixtures only where the specification explicitly defines public test vectors. Clearly label test-only key material.

Keep resource limits bounded. Do not replace bounded queues/maps/caches with unbounded structures without an architecture amendment and adversarial test coverage.

## 7. Documentation rules

When changing an accepted contract:

- update the normative contract/ADR first or in the same commit;
- update examples, roadmap, failure/security docs, and test matrices that inherit the changed rule;
- update frozen fixtures if and only if the protocol decision intentionally changes;
- check relative Markdown links after moves/renames;
- avoid duplicating normative constants in new prose unless there is a drift check or a clear canonical source.

Use **InterWeave** for the project/display name and `interweave` for machine/wire identifiers. Preserve genuine integration names such as Claude Code, `claude-channel`, libp2p, GossipSub, AutoNAT, and Kademlia.

## 8. Licensing

InterWeave first-party code and documentation are licensed **Apache-2.0**. The top-level `LICENSE` is canonical.

When Cargo crates are activated, use the workspace license (`license.workspace = true`) unless an explicitly reviewed third-party/subproject exception requires otherwise.

Do not:

- replace the project license without an explicit project decision;
- strip upstream copyright/license notices;
- relabel third-party material as InterWeave-owned;
- copy dependency source into the repository without preserving its licensing obligations.

If a new dependency or copied asset has unclear licensing, stop and resolve that before landing it.

## 9. Git/change discipline

- Keep commits coherent and reviewable.
- Preserve repository history when moving files (`git mv` when appropriate).
- Do not mix unrelated architecture changes into implementation commits.
- Do not commit generated build outputs, local runtime state, or secrets.
- Do not push, publish releases, or modify a remote unless explicitly instructed.
- Before committing, inspect the complete staged diff, not only files you remember editing.

For repository-wide changes, verify at minimum:

- `git status` is understood;
- Markdown relative links still resolve;
- YAML/config examples still parse;
- ADR structure/indexing is valid;
- frozen fixture checks still pass where applicable;
- no forbidden production artifacts were introduced outside the active stage;
- `git fsck --full` passes before archive handoff when a full repository ZIP is requested.

## 10. Working principle

Implement from the bottom up and make boundaries executable through tests. Do not let convenience at a higher layer weaken a lower-layer invariant.
